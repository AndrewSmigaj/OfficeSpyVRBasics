# OfficeSpyVRBasics

Description: A prototype for a Office espionage VR game.  In this experience you break into an office and 
find and photocopy documents. This represents the most basic mechanics in a larger more robust experience
where you have to deal with employees such as latenight office workers, guards, and janitors and utilize
a much richer set of interactions with the environment to solve puzzles and ultimately steal company 
secrets.

Assets used:  Progrids, Probuilder, XR Interaction Toolkit, Oculus Plugin, Snaps Office prototyping pack, Unity Input System, a few random office models found online.

Challenges:  As a beginner to VR and Unity development a primary challenge was making sure wiring was correct,
especially when trying to extend and add new interaction logic.  The XR interaction toolkit, especially with
the new Input System, has a lot of moving parts to check and double check. 

I was particularly proud of adding multiple lefthand controllers the user could swap through, and the
photocopier which actually copies documents placed in it.

Given time the next iteration would be:
1.  Scoring system:  number of 'extra' documents retrieved, other scores.
2.  A late night employee:  putting sleeping pill in coffee and hide.
3.  Employee raycasting for line of sight.
4.  Finding special object unlocks a different mode ('janitor mode')
5.  Lighting and graphics overhaul
